Omer Farooq's blog on GitHub Pages.

I followed [Travis Illig](http://www.paraesthesia.com/archive/2014/08/22/moved-blog-to-github-pages/) and moved my blog from Wordpress to GitHub Pages. 
I just forked his blog, thanks Travis. 

- `bundle exec jekyll serve --watch` to run the site local
- `rake test` for HTML:Proofer link testing
- `bundle update` to get the latest libraries
